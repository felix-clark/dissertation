Charged particles produced in collisions at the ATLAS \ac{IP} travel helical paths through the \id due to the solenoid magnetic field.
The three subdetectors register hits at various space-point locations as each of these particles passes through them, often 11 silicon and 15--30 \trt hits for a typical particle of sufficiently high \pt.
The trajectories of these particles must be reconstructed from the collection of all the space-point hits in order to infer the initial momentum of all of the collision products.
This procedure is non-trivial and computationally intensive, particularly because the trajectories of charged particles are altered when they pass through detector elements, via ionization energy loss and multiple scattering.

%% Kalman filter -- dedicated subsection?
A helical track path is defined by the 5-tuple
\( \left( d_0, z_0, \theta, \phi, q/p \right) \)
where $d_0$ and $z_0$ are the transverse and longitudinal distance from the beamspot at the point of closest approach, $\theta$ and $\phi$ are the polar and azimuthal angles of the track at this point, and $q/p$ is the inverse magnitude of the track's total momentum signed by the charge of the particle\footnote{This ratio is related to the transverse radius of curvature $R$ and the axial magnetic field $B$ by $q/p = \sin \theta / B R$.} (\Cref{fig:trk_params}).
However, every interaction with a detector element modifies a charged particle's trajectory through ionization energy loss and multiple scattering.
Since there are tens of hits in most tracks, a typical track has $\mathcal{O}(100)$ parameters in its description, and the parameters before and after a hit are not independent.
It is computationally infeasible to process a single global fit for each track candidate with this many correlated parameters.
