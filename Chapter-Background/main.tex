\section{Quantum chromodynamics}
\subsection{History and experimental motivation}

The atomic nucleus was discovered in the early 20th century \cite{Rutherford:1911zz}, and a few years later it was determined that it was composed of protons ($p$).
An additional, electrically-neutral nuclear constituent particle was proposed soon after and the neutron ($n$) was finally discovered in the early 1930s \cite{Chadwick:1932ma}.
Clearly some new type of interaction, strong enough to overcome electrostatic repulsion between protons, bound the nucleons ($p$ and $n$) together in the nucleus.
A particle field was proposed to mediate this strong interaction, dubbed the pion ($\pi^\pm$, $\pi^0$) \cite{Yukawa:1935xg}.
Since the strong interaction only acts over a length scale of about 2 fm, the mediating pion was predicted to have a mass of about 100 \MeV\footnote{The potential mediated by a boson of mass $m$ is proportional to \( - exp(-mcr/\hbar)/r\), where $r$ is the separation between a pair of participants. Thus the mass of a mediating boson for a potential with a characteristic cutoff length of $\lambda$ is $m = \hbar/c\lambda = \frac{200 \MeVcc \textrm{fm}}{\lambda}$.}.
The charged pion was indeed discovered experimentally in 1947 \cite{Lattes:1947mw}.
Pions can be interpreted as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons corresponding to the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, which explains their relatively small masses.

The rapidly expanding body of observed hadrons and their allowed decays suggested additional conserved quantum numbers suggested that they could be composed of constituent particles.
It was noticed that hadrons can be organized by their quantum numbers in a manner described by an $SU(3)$ \emph{flavor} symmetry \cite{GellMann:1962xb}.
This suggests that hadrons are composed of constituent particles called \emph{quarks}; however, the quark model was not immediately accepted because free quarks were not (and still have not been) observed.
Because electrons are point-like particles to the limits of current experiments, a scattering process $e^- A \rightarrow e^- X$ is dependent only on the internal structure of $A$.

\subsection{The QCD Lagrangian}
The lagrangian density of QCD is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Lagr_\mathrm{QCD} \equiv -\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi} \left( i \slashed{D} - m \right) \psi \; .
\end{equation}
Here repeated indices are summed, where $\mu$ and $\nu$ indicate spacetime indices and $a$, $b$, and $c$ indicate color indices.
The covariant derivative
\[ D_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu - i g A^a_\mu t^a\]
where $A^a_\mu$ is the gluon field, $t^a$ are the generators of the $SU(3)$ gauge group, and $g$ is the coupling constant.
The gluon field strength tensor is
\[ G^a_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^c_\nu \]
with the $SU(3)$ structure constants defined such that
\[ [t^a,t^b] = if^{abc}t^c \; .\]
The quark fields are defined such that the mass matrix $m$ is diagonal:
\[ \bar{\psi}m\psi = \sum_{q = u,d,s,\ldots} m_{q}\bar{q}q \]
The quark masses $m_q$ are generated by the mechanism of spontaneous electro-weak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs field, coupling to fermions and electro-weak gauge bosons, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value.
This procedure induces a breaking of chiral symmetry $SU(N_f) \times SU(N_f) \rarrow SU(N_f)$ in the massless Lagrangian. %% reword. original lagrangian has chiral symmetry, but vacuum does not.

The QCD Lagrangian has a symmetry under the gauge transformation defined as...

Though the focus of this thesis is not on the physics of jet fragmentation, control of hard processes is essential to correctly extract observable quantities of interest.
This section will describe the physics behind jets.

TODO: Some of this discussion may be better moved elsewhere; for instance, nuclear modification may be appropriate in ``evidence for QGP''
