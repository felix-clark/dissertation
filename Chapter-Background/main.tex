\subsection{History and experimental motivation}
\subsection{The QCD Lagrangian}
The lagrangian density of QCD is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Lagr_\mathrm{QCD} \equiv -\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi} \left( i \slashed{D} - m \right) \psi \; .
\end{equation}
Here repeated indices are summed, where $\mu$ and $\nu$ indicate spacetime indices and $a$, $b$, and $c$ indicate color indices.
The covariant derivative
\[ D_\mu \equiv \partial_\mu - i g A^a_\mu t^a\]
where $A^a_\mu$ is the gluon field, $t^a$ are the generators of the $SU(3)$ gauge group, and $g$ is the coupling constant.
The gluon field strength tensor is
\[ G^a_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^c_\nu \]
with the $SU(3)$ structure constants defined such that
\[ [t^a,t^b] = if^{abc}t^c \; .\]
The quark fields are defined such that the mass matrix $m$ is diagonal:
\[ \bar{\psi}m\psi = \sum_{q = u,d,s,\ldots} m_{q}\bar{q}q \]
The quark masses $m_q$ are generated by the mechanism of spontaneous electro-weak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs field, coupling to fermions and electro-weak gauge bosons, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value.
This procedure induces a breaking of chiral symmetry $SU(N_f) \times SU(N_f) \rarrow SU(N_f)$ in the massless Lagrangian. %% reword. original lagrangian has chiral symmetry, but vacuum does not.

The QCD Lagrangian has a symmetry under the gauge transformation defined as...

\section{Jet production and fragmentation}
Though the focus of this thesis is not on the physics of jet fragmentation, control of hard processes is essential to correctly extract observable quantities of interest.
This section will describe the physics behind jets.

TODO: Some of this discussion may be better moved elsewhere; for instance, nuclear modification may be appropriate in ``evidence for QGP''

lorentz contraction in infinite momentum frame, transverse freeze-out, factorization

\section{Femtoscopy in heavy ion collisions}
This section will describe from a theoretical perspective what femtoscopy is and what it aims to achieve. The application of these techniques to experimental data will be addressed in \Cref{ch:analysis}.
\subsection{Imaging the source density function}

justify ignoring strong force; describe Coulomb correction (save jet fragmentation details for later)
