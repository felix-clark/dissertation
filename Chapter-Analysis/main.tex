\section{Data set}

The analyses presented in this thesis use the data from the \ac{LHC} 2013 \pPb at a center-of-mass energy of \pPbenergy with an integrated luminosity of \pPblumi.
The Pb ions had an energy per nucleon of $1.57 \TeV$ and collided with the $4 \TeV$ proton beam resulting in a net longitudinal boost of the center-of-mass system of $\ycm = 0.465$ in the proton direction relative to the ATLAS laboratory frame.
The \pPb\ run was divided into two periods between which the directions of the proton and lead beams were
reversed. 
The data are presented using the convention that the proton beam travels in the forward ($+z$) direction and the lead beam travels in the backward ($-z$) direction.
When the data from these two periods are combined, the \minbias triggers sampled a total luminosity, after prescale, of $24.5~\mu\textrm{b}^{-1}$ and yielded a total of 44 million events over the full centrality.

For results reported as a function of centrality, an additional \ac{HighET} trigger selection is included in the most central bin that requires the total transverse energy in both sides of the \ac{FCal} to be at least 65 \GeV.
The \ac{HighET} trigger sampled a total luminosity of $41.4~\mu\textrm{b}^{-1}$ after prescale and yielded 700 thousand events to the sample.
Events from this trigger are only included in the 0--1\% centrality interval, where the \ac{HighET} trigger is fully efficient.

The azimuthally-dependent results use central events with offline charged-particle multiplicity \Nch of at least 150, where only tracks with $\pt > 400~\MeV$ are counted in this number.
Several \acp{HMT} are included to boost the sample, with offline \Nch cutoffs at 100, 130, 150, 180, 200, and 225 tracks.
These \acp{HMT} provide a crucial 6.7 million events, as the \minbias triggers provide only 200 000 events at $\Nch > 150$.

All events are required to pass a set of \minbias selection criteria.
Events are required to be included in the latest Good Runs List from ATLAS, which rejects events recorded in conjunction with a technical difficulty in the detector.
The \minbias trigger requires either one hit in both sides of the \ac{MBTS} or two hits in one side.
Additional \ac{HighET} and high multiplicity triggers are included in some analysis bins as discussed above.
%% Events with an offline multiplicity lower than the nominal trigger threshold are excluded, as each of these HMTs reaches an efficiency near 1 near their nominal turn-on. This rejects events that fire a trigger in its turn-on region, as these samples can in principle be biased.
%% In practice no significant difference in the results is observed whether or not events in the HMT triggers' turn-ons are included, so using the nominal turn-on multiplicity is sufficient.
A timing cut is placed on the \ac{MBTS} hits in each side such that $|\Delta t_{AC}| < 10~\textrm{ns}$.
No more than one reconstructed \ac{PV} or strong vertex (where a strong vertex has more than 10 tracks or a total \pt of tracks greater than $6~\GeV$) is permitted in each event.
Diffractive events are identified for rejection by a gap of two units of pseudorapidity in event activity on the Pb-going side of the calorimeters \cite{HION-2012-15}.
Pileup events are also discarded using a run-dependent upper limit on the Pb-going \ac{ZDC}.
In addition, events are discarded if an error flag is recorded in the \ac{LAr} or tile calorimeter systems, or if there is an indication that the event was not completely recorded.

\section{Centrality determination}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics{fcal_et_total.pdf}
\caption{The distribution of the total transverse energy in the \ac{FCal} in the Pb-going direction (\sumETPb) for the events used in the centrality-dependent analysis. Dashed lines are shown at the boundaries of the centrality intervals, and the discontinuity at $\sumETPb = 91.08~\GeV$ corresponds to the lower \sumETPb boundary of the 0--1\% centrality interval.}
\label{fig:fcal_et}
\end{figure}

The centralities of the \pPb\ events are characterized following the procedures described in \Ref{\cite{HION-2012-15}}, using the total transverse energy in the Pb-going side of the \ac{FCal}, \sumETPb.
The use of the \ac{FCal} for measuring centrality has the advantage that it is not sensitive to multiplicity flvuctuations in the kinematic region covered by the inner detector, where the measurements are performed.
Measurements are presented in this paper for the centrality intervals listed in \Cref{table:npart}.
The events selected using the \ac{HighET} trigger are used only in the 0--1\% centrality interval.
\Cref{fig:fcal_et} shows the distribution of \sumETPb\ values obtained from events included in this
measurement.
The discontinuity in the spectrum occurs at the low edge of the 0--1\% centrality interval, above which the \ac{HighET} events are included.

For each centrality interval, the average multiplicity of charged particles with $\pt > 100~\MeV$ and $|\eta| < 1.5$, \avgdNdeta, and the corresponding average number of participating nucleons, \avgNpart, are obtained from a previous publication \cite{HION-2012-15}.
Since this analysis uses finer centrality intervals (no wider than 10\% of the total centrality range) than
those used in \Ref{\cite{HION-2012-15}}, a linear interpolation over the Glauber \avgNpart is used to construct additional values for \avgdNdeta based on the published results.
This interpolation is justified by the result in \Ref{\cite{HION-2012-15}} that charged-particle multiplicity is proportional to \avgNpart in the peripheral region.
The values and uncertainties from this procedure are listed in \Cref{table:npart}.

\section{Flow vector determination}

The 2nd-order azimuthal Fourier components $Q_2$ of the energy flow are defined by
\begin{equation}
  Q_2 = \sum_{i}  \et{}_i \begin{pmatrix} \cos 2\phi_i \\ \sin 2\phi_i \end{pmatrix} \; ,\\
\end{equation}
where the sum is taken over calorimeter cells and $\phi_i$ is the ATLAS detector coordinate $\phi$ of the $i$th calorimeter cell.
The two-component elliptic flow vector \qt is defined in terms of $Q_2$, normalized by the 0th-order Fourier component
\begin{equation}
  \qt = \frac{Q_2}{\sum_i \et{}_i } \; .\\
\end{equation}

The elliptic flow used in this analysis is taken from calorimeter cells on the Pb-going side of the detector with $\eta < -2.5$ for period B or $\eta > 2.5$ for period A, which has the beam orientation reversed. This forward cut is made so as to not overlap with the inner detector.

The second-order event plane angle \psit is defined as
\begin{equation}
2\psit = \mathrm{atan2}(\qt{}_{,y},\qt{}_{,x})
\end{equation}
and the magnitude of the flow vector is $|\qt| = \sqrt{\qtx^2 + \qty^2}$.
An equivalent expression of these equations is
\[
\qt = |\qt| e^{i2\psit} = \frac{\sum_i \et{}_i e^{i2\phi_i}}{\sum_i \et{}_i} \; .
\]
A sketch of the relationship of event plane angle to transverse momentum is shown in \Cref{fig:ep_cartoon}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{event_plane_cartoon.png}
  \caption{The event plane angle $\psit$ in relation to the elliptic moment of transverse energy. An exaggerated example of the transverse profile in a hydrodynamic system is shown in blue. The pressure gradients are larger along the axis of narrower extent, leading to greater final momentum in that direction.}
\label{fig:ep_cartoon}
\end{figure}

\subsection{First-order correction}
Due to non-uniformities in the calorimeter response in azimuth, the measurement of the \qt vector may be biased. This leads to a non-uniform distribution of event plane angle \psit with an additive term proportional to $\cos (2(\psit - \phi_0))$ which is obviously not physical.
This bias is corrected by subtracting off the mean \qt on a run-by-run basis.
The mean components of the \qt vector are shown in \Cref{fig:mean_q2}.
The correction factors are statistically consistent in different multiplicity intervals, so all multiplicities are combined to increase their statistical significance.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{can_qx.eps}
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{can_qy.eps}
\caption{The average components of the \qt vector $\langle\qtx\rangle$ (left) and $\langle\qty\rangle$ (right) for each run. Runs up to 218589 are from period A, and use $\eta > 2.5$, while runs after this are from period B and use $\eta < -2.5$.}
\label{fig:mean_q2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Second-order correction}

Some additional non-uniformities persist in the \psit distribution even after correcting for the nonvanishing $\langle\qt\rangle$.
These show up in higher-order Fourier terms like $\cos (4\psit)$ and $\sin(4\psit)$ in the distribution of the event plane angle \psit.
They arise because detector irregularities can lead to higher-order distortions in the distribution of the matrix of products $\qt{}_i \qt{}_j$.
In order to correct for these and make $\langle \qt{}_i \qt{}_j \rangle$ proportional to the identity matrix, the mean-corrected \qt vector is multiplied by the normalized inverse square root of the covariance matrix
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
  \langle \qty^2 \rangle + D & -\langle\qtx\qty\rangle \\
  -\langle\qtx\qty\rangle & \langle \qtx^2 \rangle + D
  \end{array} \right) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $D = \sqrt{\langle \qtx^2 \rangle \langle \qty^2 \rangle - \langle \qtx \qty \rangle ^2}$ and $N = D\left(\langle \qtx^2 \rangle + \langle\qty^2\rangle + 2D\right)$. The components of the covariance matrix are shown in \Cref{fig:mean_q2_cov}. This multiplication causes the corrected \qt vector to have no skew and have the same width in the \qtx and \qty axes.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{can_qxx.eps}
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{can_qyy.eps}\\
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{can_qxy.eps}
\caption{The average components of the $<\qt{}_i \qt{}_j>$ matrix for each run. Runs up to 218589 are from period A, and use $\eta > 2.5$, while runs after this are from period B and use $\eta < -2.5$.}
\label{fig:mean_q2_cov}
\end{figure}

As is the case for the mean subtraction correction, the correction factors are consistent over multiplicity so the events are combined for improved statistical significance in the correction.
Once these two corrections are applied run-by-run, the \psit distribution is flat (\Cref{fig:dNdpsi2_corr,fig:dNdpsi2_corr_binned}).

\end{figure}


\subsection{Event plane angular resolution}
\label{subsubsec:epres}

The event plane angular resolution, defined as $\langle \cos(2 \delta \psit) \rangle$ where $\delta \psit$ is the difference between true and measured \psit, is shown in \Cref{fig:ep_res} for the calorimeters at $\eta < -2.5$.
The resolution is shown separately for periods A and B, but since they are comparable only the combined resolution is used.
This quantity can be calculated from data using the three-sub-detector method, where two other subdetectors are chosen with rapidity ranges $-2 < \eta< -0.5$ and $0 < \eta < 1.5$.
Here explicit pseudorapidity ranges define each subdetector, with a pseudorapidity gap of 0.5 left in between each subdetector so that biases are not introduced from jets overlapping two subdetectors.
The event plane resolution of the nominal subdetector can be calculated with the following expression.

\begin{equation}
\langle \cos(2 \delta \psit) \rangle = \sqrt{ \frac{\langle \cos(2\psit^A - 2\psit) \rangle \langle \cos(2\psit^B - 2\psit) \rangle }{\langle \cos(2\psit^A - 2\psit^B) \rangle} }\\
\end{equation}
Here $\psit^A$ refers to the event plane measured using calorimeters with $-2 < \eta< -0.5$ and $\psit^B$ refers to that with $0 < \eta < 1.5$.
Each of these additional subdetectors has first- and second-order corrections applied, which are derived for each subdetector in the same way that the corrections are derived for the nominal subdetector with $\eta < -2.5$.
Systematic uncertainties in the event plane resolution are taken from two sources.
The alternate subdetectors are shifted by $\Delta\eta = +0.5$, and the difference in the EP resolution is symmetrized.
Also, the alternate subdetectors are calculated using the \qt from tracks, weighted by their \pt. This difference is also symmetrized, and these two contributions are added in quadrature.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{epRes.pdf}\\
\caption{The event plane resolution as a function of the magnitude of the flow vector $|\qt|$ calculated using calorimeter cells with $\eta < -2.5$. Four different intervals of reconstructed track multiplicity \Nch used in the analysis are shown. The systematic uncertainties are shown in the bands, and statistical uncertainties are too small to be visible.}

\subsection{Coulomb correction}
The residual strong force between charged pions is subdominant to the Coulomb effect and can be neglected in final-state effects \cite{Lednicky:2005tb}.
In heavy ion collisions the Bohr radius of a pair of pions ($a_{\pi} = 387.5 \textrm{ fm}$) is significantly larger than the source size, which is on the order of a few fermi.
The nonrelativistic limit is appropriate since in the region of interest the pions have low relative momentum.
In the limit where the pions come from a point source, their outgoing wavefunction squared is given by the Gamow factor

\begin{equation} \frac{\left| \psi (q, r=0) \right|^2}{\left| \psi (q, r\rightarrow\infty) \right|^2} = G(\qinv) \equiv \frac{4\pi}{a \qinv}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{4\pi}{a \qinv}} - 1} \end{equation}

where $a$ is the Bohr radius.
(The literature contains various conventions for the factors of 2.
Here the Bohr radius contains the reduced mass and this definition of $q$ has no factor of $1/2$.)
For opposite-charged pairs, the correction can be applied by taking $a \to -a$, as this effectively flips the sign of the coupling constant $\alpha_{EM}$.

For a source that is extended in space, a correction to this expression is required.
For a spherical Gaussian source of effective size \Reff, the formula for a more precise correction factor $K(\qinv)$ is calculated in \Ref{\cite{Maj:2009ue}} in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function ${}_2 F_2$.
\begin{equation} K(\qinv) = G(\qinv) \left[ 1 + \frac{8\Reff}{\sqrt{\pi}a} {}_2 F_2 \left( \frac{1}{2}, 1; \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}; -\Reff^2 \qinv^2 \right) \right] \end{equation}
The analytic gradient of the correlation function parameterization is used in the fitting algorithm, so the derivative with respect to \Reff is also required:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial K(\qinv)}{\partial \Reff} = G(\qinv) \frac{8}{\sqrt{\pi}a} {}_1 F_1 \left( 1; \frac{3}{2}; -\Reff^2 \qinv^2 \right) \; .
\end{equation}
The effective size \Reff described here cannot be connected \emph{a priori} to the HBT radii without additional model-dependent assumptions.
It is taken to be proportional to \Rinv with the constant of proportionality adjusted as a systematic variation.

Implementations of ${}_2F_2 (a_1, a_2; b_1, b_2; z)$ are not generally available.
%% Series approximations for this function are produced here at small and large negative $z$ (used with a cutoff around $z \approx -18$), respectively.
A series expansion around small $z$ follows direction from the definition.
\begin{equation} {}_2F_2 \left( \frac{1}{2}, 1; \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}; z \right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{(2n+1) \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)_n} \end{equation}
The Pochhammer symbol $(a)_n$ is used to denote the rising factorial $(a)_n \equiv a(a+1)...(a+n-1) = \frac{\Gamma(a+n)}{\Gamma(a)}$.
An asymptotic expansion around $z \to - \infty$ can be derived.
\begin{equation} {}_2F_2 \left( \frac{1}{2}, 1; \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{2}; z \right) \approx \frac{\pi^{3/2}}{4\sqrt{-z}} - \sum_{n=1}^{n < |z| + 3/2} \frac{(2n-3)!!}{(2n-1) 2^n |z|^n}  \end{equation}
This expression is a formally divergent asymptotic series for large negative $z$, so the cutoff is chosen after the smallest term.
In practice it agrees to within several digits of precision relatively quickly.

Corresponding expressions for the confluent hypergeometric function appearing in the derivative are given by:
\begin{equation}
 {}_1F_1 \left( 1;\frac{3}{2}; z \right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)_n} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  {}_1F_1 \left( 1; \frac{3}{2}; z \right) \approx \sum_{n=1}^{n < |z| + 3/2} \frac{(2n-3)!!}{2^n |z|^n} \; \textrm{for } z \rightarrow -\infty
\end{equation}

To apply the Coulomb correction in 3D out-side-long coordinates, the average \kt in each bin is used to contract compute \qinv from $\mathbf{q}$.
The following expression takes advantage of working in the \ac{LCMF} so that $k_L = 0$.
\begin{equation}
\qinv^2 = |\mathbf{q}|^2 - \Gamma^2 + \sqrt{\Gamma^4 - 4 |\mathbf{k}_\mathrm{T}|^2 \qout^2} \label{eqn:q3_to_qinv}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^2 = 2 m_{\pi}^2 + 2 |\mathbf{k}_\mathrm{T}|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{q}|^2 \; .
\end{equation}

\section{Hard-process contribution}
\label{sec:jet_frag}

An additional contribution to the correlation function with a width in \qinv of order 0.5--1 \GeV\ arises from hard processes in the event.
It is more prominent at high \kt, which suggests that the correlation comes from jet fragmentation.
This origin of the effect was confirmed by running \Hijing with the minimum \pt for hard scattering turned up to $20 \GeV$ from the default of $2 \GeV$, which causes this feature to diminish (see \Cref{fig:hard_process_min_pt}).
\Hijing has no Coulomb or Bose-Einstein effects, so any effects in \Cref{fig:hard_process_min_pt} are from charge/momentum conservation, resonance decays, and jet fragmentation.
The effect is more pronounced at high \kt and low multiplicities, where particle pairs are more likely to have come from the same mini-jet.

It should be noted that MC generators all tend to over-estimate the amplitude of the contribution from hard processes.
In the past the double ratio has been studied (i.e. the ratio of the correlation function in data to MC), but this produces a suspicious depletion in the affected \qinv region.

Removing the hard-scattering processes in this range diminishes or removes the non-femtoscopic signal.

\label{fig:background_ang_same_vs_opp_mc}
\end{figure}

Rather than use a double-ratio, some femtoscopic analyses have described the background by allowing the amplitude to be a free fit parameter.
This analysis uses a data-driven method to tune it by comparing to opposite-sign pairs (Coulomb-corrected and with the largest resonance contributions removed), which do not have a Bose-Einstein correlation.
\Cref{fig:background_amp_inv_vs_ang_data}, of which it should be emphasized is taken from data, shows that the choice to tune from the amplitude of Gaussian fits to $\qinv$ or $\Delta\eta, \Delta\phi$ correlations does not significantly impact the result.
This further supports the interpretation that the enhancement in $\qinv$ comes from hard processes, as the peak in angular coordinates is commonly associated with jets.
\Cref{fig:background_ang_same_vs_opp_mc} shows the amplitudes of the jet contribution to $C(\Delta\eta, \Delta\phi)$ comparing both $++$ and $--$ to $+-$.
The correlation between $\pm\pm$ and $+-$ demonstrates that, at least in principle, the $+-$ correlation functions can constrain the hard-process contribution in $\pm\pm$ correlation functions.

Though some resonances are removed from the $+-$ correlation functions, the effect of jet fragmentation is not the same in same-sign as it is in opposite-sign.
A mapping must be developed between $+-$ and $\pm\pm$, so the relationship between the two correlation functions is studied in Monte Carlo simulations.

To isolate the effect of jet fragmentation, particles from weak decays ($\eta$, $\eta'$, and $\omega$) were excluded.
Pairs of particles from two-body resonance decays were also neglected, in order to remove mass peaks in the correlation function.
We also apply the same pair mass cut around the $\rho$ resonance that is used in the data, since the removal of the corresponding region of phase space has a significant effect on the shape of the correlation function.

\subsection{Monte Carlo generators}
\label{subsec:generators}

A number of Monte Carlo generators were utilized during studies of the non-HBT part of the correlation function.
Detector simulation is not run on these samples.
In each of the following samples, 50 million (250 million for \PYEight) \minbias events are generated at a center of mass energy per nucleon of \pPbenergy.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \Hijing p+Pb \cite{Gyulassy:1994ew}\\
  The energy and boost settings are the same as in the nominal \pPb reconstructed simulation, except that the minimum hard-scattering transverse momentum is adjusted as described above.
  Turning off the flow, which shifts the $\phi$ of particles in order to reproduce the flow harmonics $v_n$, was not found to have a significant effect on the momentum-space correlation functions.
  The minimum hard-scattering \pt parameter\footnote{HIPR18} is adjusted to show that the non-femtoscopic background originates from minijets, as described in \Cref{fig:hard_process_min_pt}.

\item \Hijing \pp\\
  The simulation is run at $\sqrt{s} = 5 \TeV$ with all of the same settings as the \pPb sample, except that both incoming particles are protons.
  No rapidity boost is not applied, because the collision system is symmetric.

\item \Pythia 8.2 \pp \cite{Sjostrand:2007gs}\\
The default ATLAS tune "UE AU2-CTEQ6L1" is used with \PYEight at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02 \TeV$.
This utilizes the CTEQ 6L1 \ac{PDF} from LHAPDF6 \cite{Buckley:2014ana}.

\item \Herwig++ 2.7 \pp \cite{Bahr:2008pv}\\
A known bug in \Herwig++ 2.7.1 prevented the use of the CTEQ6 \ac{PDF}, so the default MRST \ac{PDF} was used instead.
This should not be a significant issue for these purposes, because the jet fragmentation is not very dependent on the initial state.

It should be noted that the correlation functions predicted by \Herwig are in such significant and obvious disagreement with those seen in the data that they cannot be used directly.
The \Herwig sample is used to compare the variation of certain behavior of the correlation functions compared to \Pythia in order to establish an estimate for the systematic uncertainty arising from the details of the generator (as will be described in \Cref{subsec:herwig_vs_pythia}).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Jet fragmentation in Lorentz invariant correlation function}
\label{subsec:jet_frag_inv}

In order to describe the background satisfactorily, it was found necessary to loosen the assumption of a Gaussian form in \qinv.
The \qinv correlation functions in \Pythia 8 were fit to
\begin{equation} C(q) = 1 + \lbkgd e^{-|\Rbkgd \qinv|^{\abkgd}} \end{equation}
The results are shown in \Cref{fig:background_alpha_pythia8,fig:background_qinv_same_vs_opp_pythia8}.

The parameter is fit to a function of the form $\abkgd = 2 - 0.0497 \log \left(1 + e^{50.9(\kt - 0.493)} \right)$, with \kt in GeV.

\label{fig:background_qinv_same_vs_opp_pythia8_fits}
\end{figure}

In one attempt to constrain the background, correlation functions were generated in \Pythia 8 (which does not have Bose-Einstein or Coulomb effects) and the width and height of the correlation functions were compared from like-sign to unlike-sign.
\Cref{fig:background_qinv_same_vs_opp_pythia8} shows the comparison for each \kt bin for a few choices of multiplicity ($26 \leq N_{ch}^{tr} \leq36$, $37 \leq N_{ch}^{tr} \leq48$, $49 \leq N_{ch}^{tr} \leq64$, $65 \leq N_{ch}^{tr}$).
The amplitudes are compared on a log scale and straight lines are fit for each \kt bin.
The widths $\Rbkgd^{\pm\pm}$ and $\Rbkgd^{+-}$ are taken to be proportional to each other by a constant factor.
This assumption is clearly not perfect but becomes increasingly accurate at high \kt, where the background contribution is largest.

This \kt dependence of fit parameters is used as a mapping from opposite-sign fits in the data to a fixed background gaussian.
In summary we are requiring that

\begin{align}
\lbkgd^{\pm\pm} &= \mu(\kt) \left(\lbkgd^{+-}\right)^{\nu(\kt)} \label{eqn:lambdaBackPar}\\
\Rbkgd^{\pm\pm} &= \rho \Rbkgd^{+-} \label{eqn:rBackPar}
\end{align}

and fixing $\mu(k_T)$, $\nu(k_T)$, and $\rho$ from the Monte Carlo (results shown in \Cref{fig:background_qinv_same_vs_opp_pythia8_fits})):

\begin{align}
\log \mu (\kt [\textrm{GeV}]) &= -2.26 + \frac{1.97}{1 + e^{-10.1 (\kt - 0.383)}} \label{eqn:mu}\\
\nu(\kt [\textrm{GeV}]) &= 0.579 + \frac{4.38}{1 + e^{-14.4 (\kt - 0.425)}} \label{eqn:nu}\\
\rho &= 1.33 \label{eqn:rho} %% this constant is independent over rapidity to within ~2%
\end{align}
The statistical errors on the above parameters are on the order of 10\%.


\subsection{Jet fragmentation in three dimensions}
\label{subsec:jet_frag_3d}

In the longitudinally co-moving frame of a particle pair produced in a jet, on averate the axis of the jet will be aligned with the ``out'' direction and the plane transverse to the jet's momentum will be spanned by the ``side'' and ``long'' directions. In three dimensions the correlation from jet fragmentation is factorized into components which separately describe the ``out'' direction and both the ``side'' and ``long'' directions:

\begin{align}
C_{\mathrm{bkgd}}(\mathbf{q}) = 1 + \lbkgd^\mathrm{osl} \exp\left(-\left| R_\mathrm{bkgd}^\mathrm{out} \qout \right|^{\abkgd^\mathrm{out}} - \left| R_\mathrm{bkgd}^\mathrm{sl} \qsl \right|^{\abkgd^\mathrm{sl}}\right) \label{eqn:jet_frag_form_3d}
\end{align}

with $\qsl = \sqrt{\qside^2 + \qlong^2}$.
The shape parameters $\abkgd^\mathrm{out}$ and $\abkgd^\mathrm{sl}$ are fixed to 1.5 and 1.7 respectively, as shown in \Cref{fig:pythia_bkgd_alpha}.
These parameters are not statistically consistent with constants independent of \kt and multiplicity.
However, at larger \kt, where the jet fragmentation is significant, the values do not vary enough to change the shape of the function drastically.
What is lost in precision is gained in the utility of having good control over the remaining parameters.
A systematic check is performed to investigate the effect of the shape on the results, and the results are seen to be insensitive at the 1\% level to variations of 0.1 in the \abkgd parameters.

Just as is done for the \qinv correlation functions, the amplitudes for three dimensional jet correlations are compared between opposite- and same-sign pairs (\Cref{fig:background_qosl_lambda_same_vs_opp_pythia8}).

\begin{align}
\lbkgd^{\mathrm{osl},\pm\pm} &= \mu(\kt) \left(\lbkgd^{\mathrm{osl}+-}\right)^{\nu(\kt)} \label{eqn:lambdaBackParOSL}\\
\Rbkgd^{\mathrm{sl},\pm\pm} &= \Rbkgd^{\mathrm{sl}+-} + \Delta\Rbkgd^{\mathrm{sl}}(\kt) \label{eqn:rBackParSL}\\
\Rbkgd^{\mathrm{out},\pm\pm} &= \Rbkgd^{\mathrm{out}+-} + \Delta\Rbkgd^{\mathrm{out}}(\kt) \label{eqn:rBackParOut}
\end{align}

The numerical values used for the mapping the amplitude $\lbkgd^\mathrm{osl}$ (\Cref{fig:background_qosl_lambda_same_vs_opp_pythia8}), fragmentation width colinear with the jet axis $\Rbkgd^\mathrm{out}$ (\Cref{fig:background_qosl_Rout_same_vs_opp_pythia8}), and fragmentation width transverse to the jet axis $\Rbkgd^\mathrm{sl}$ (\Cref{fig:background_qosl_R_same_vs_opp_pythia8}) are as follows:

\begin{align}
\log \mu (\kt [\textrm{GeV}]) &= -3.9 + 9.5 \kt - 6.4 \kt^2 \label{eqn:mu_osl}\\
\nu(\kt [\textrm{GeV}]) &= 0.03 + 2.6 \kt - 1.6 \kt^2 \label{eqn:nu_osl}\\
\Delta \Rbkgd^\mathrm{out} (\kt [\textrm{GeV}]) &= 0.43 - 0.49 \kt \label{eqn_rbkgdout}\\
\Delta \Rbkgd^\mathrm{sl} (\kt [\textrm{GeV}]) &= \frac{0.51}{1 + (1.30\kt)^2} \label{eqn_rbkgdsl}
\end{align}

\subsection{Difference between collision systems}

The mapping from opposite- to same- sign correlation functions is derived from \Pythia 8, which simulates \pp~collisions but not nuclear collisions.
Since the background structure is caused primarily by the fragmentation of mini-jets, a large difference is not expected between \pp~and \pPb~systems.
Nevertheless, the distinction can and should be evaluated.

Since \Hijing uses an old version of \Pythia 6 its description of the fragmentation function is not up-to-date, but \Pythia alone does not simulate the same soft particle production that \Hijing does.
Thus, \PYEight p+p is used to derive the mapping between $+-$ and $\pm\pm$, then corrected slightly for the difference between p+p and p+Pb observed in \Hijing.
A comparison of \Hijing p-p and p-Pb correlation functions shows that the ratio of the background width is the same in each, at least a high \kt (about 1.08).
This justifies using the width ratio from the updated \PYEight, since it suggests that changing from a proton-proton system to a proton-lead system does not drastically alter the ratio of widths.
We also see that in \Hijing (with the width ratio is fixed to 1.08) $\log \lbkgd$ is decreased in p-Pb by $0.05$ (high \kt) to $0.2$ (low \kt) (See \Cref{fig:background_pp_ppb_comp}). This difference is made more precise in \Cref{fig:mu_hijing_pp_pPb}, which quantifies the difference in the amplitudes of the ratios of correlation functions.
The extracted scaling is applied to the background description in the data, and the spread in the attenuation is accounted for as a systematic variation.

For the amplitude comparison the width ratio from opposite to same sign is forced to be a constant 1.08, which the ratio tends to at high \kt in \Hijing for both systems. The shape, parameterized by $\abkgd$, is quite similar between the systems.}

The difference between the ratio is slightly more prominent in p+Pb, which is accounted for in the mapping and as a systematic error. The variable $\mu$ is used here because this correction and variation is applied directly into the $\mu$ of equations \Cref{eqn:lambdaBackPar,eqn:mu}.}

A direct comparison of the two is shown in \Cref{fig:comp_herwig_pythia_cent3,fig:comp_herwig_pythia_cent7}.
\Herwig tends to overestimate the mini-jet background more prominently than \PYEight does, especially at low \kt.

\subsection{Incorporating the hard-process description into fit}

This section will briefly summarize the process by which the jet background is measured and applied in the data analysis.
An example using Lorentz-invariant correlation functions will be shown.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{cqinv_charge_comp_cent6_kt4_kys1.pdf}
\caption{Correlation functions in \pPb data for opposite-charge (teal circles) and same-charge (red squares) pairs. The opposite-charge correlation function, with the most prominent resonances removed, is fit to a function of the form in \Cref{eq:bkgd_form} (blue dashed line). The violet dotted line is the estimated jet contribution in the same-charge correlation function, also of the form of \Cref{eq:bkgd_form}, and the dark red line is the full fit of \Cref{eq:correlation_function_full} to the same-charge data.}
\label{fig:hp_example}
\end{figure}

With $\abkgdinv(\kt)$, $\mu(\kt)$, $\nu(\kt)$, and $\rho$ determined from Monte Carlo generator samples, the mapping can be applied to the \pPb data.
As illustrated in \Cref{fig:hp_example}, the $+-$ correlation function is fit to \Cref{eq:bkgd_form} for $\qinv > 0.1~\GeV$, with \abkgd fixed from \PYEight and $\lbkgdinv{}^{+-}$ and $\Rbkgdinv{}^{+-}$ as free parameters.
The $\mu$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ parameters are used to infer $\lbkgdinv{}^{\pm\pm}$ and $\Rbkgdinv{}^{\pm\pm}$, which are fixed before the femtoscopic part of the correlation function is fit to $\pm\pm$ data.

\section{Correlation function fitting}

\subsection{Test statistic}
For histograms representing the same-event distribution $A(q)$ and mixed-event distribution $B(q)$, the goal is to somehow pick the best choice for the parameters of $C(q)$ such that $A \sim B C$.
When fitting to histograms that have bins with possibly small statistics, a simple $\chi^2$ minimization may not be sufficient and one must maximize a log likelihood ratio \cite{Baker1984437}, $\ln\mathcal{L}$.
A likelihood for the correlation function can be derived by assuming a flat Bayesian prior in the means for Poisson distributed $A$ and $B$, $\mu$ and $\nu$ \cite{Soltz:1994PhDT}:

\begin{align}
L(C|A,B) &= \iint d\mu \, d\nu \, P(A|\mu) P(B|\nu) \delta\left(C - \frac{\mu}{\nu} \right)\\
&= \iint d\mu \, d\nu \, \frac{\mu^{A} e^{-\mu} \nu^{B} e^{-\nu}}{A! B!} \delta\left(C - \frac{\mu}{\nu} \right)\\
&= \frac{C^A}{A! B!} \int d\nu \, \nu^{A+B+1} e^{-\nu (1+C)}\\
&= \frac{(A+B+1)! C^A}{A! B! (1+C)^{A+B+2}}
\end{align}
The choice of $C$ that maximizes this this likelihood is not simply the ratio $A/B$, but rather
\begin{equation} C_{\textrm{max}} = \frac{A}{B+2} \; .\end{equation}

The likelihood is normalized by the maximum possible likelihood so that the test statistic $-2\ln \mathcal{L}$ non-negative and zero for an exact match.
The factor of $-2$ gives it the same characteristics as $\chi^2$ (so $-2\ln\mathcal{L}$ is minimized and has $1\sigma$ errors at $\Delta (-2\ln\mathcal{L}) = 1$), and the correspondence can be shown to be exact in the high statistics limit.
The sum of the likelihood ratio over every bin $i$ is the global test statistic, which is minimized with the Minuit package \cite{James:1975dr}.
\begin{align}
-2\ln \mathcal{L} &= -2 \sum_i \ln \left[ \frac{L(C_i|A_i,B_i)}{L(C_{\textrm{max}}|A_i,B_i)} \right]\\
&= -2 \ln \left[ \frac{C_i^{A_i} (1+C_{\textrm{max}})^{A_i+B_i+2}}{C_{\textrm{max}}^{A_i} (1+C_i)^{A_i+B_i+2}} \right]\\
&= \sum_i \left\{ 2 A_i \ln \left[\frac{(1+C_i)A_i}{C_i (A_i+B_i+2)} \right] + 2(B_i+2) \ln \left[ \frac{(1+C_i)(B_i+2)}{A_i+B_i+2} \right] \right\}
\end{align}
In the above equations, $C_i$ is shorthand for $C(q_i)$, the parameterization of the correlation function at the center of the bin $i$, and $A_i$ and $B_i$ are the histogram contents at bin $i$.
%% The results of this statistic for fits in a typical centrality, \kt, and \kys interval are shown in \ref{subsec:likelihood_maps}, with different pairs of parameters varied.

In the above expression, the full form for $C$ is given by
\begin{equation}
C(q) = \mathcal{N} \left[ 1 - \lambda + \lambda K(\qinv) C_{\textrm{BE}}(q) \right] \left(1 + \lbkgd e^{-(\Rbkgd\qinv)^{\abkgd}} \right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
C_{\textrm{BE}}(q) = 1 + e^{-\sqrt{q R^2 q}}
\end{equation}
for like-sign pairs, and $C_{\textrm{BE}} = 1$ for unlike-sign pairs.
$C_{\textrm{BE}}$ can stand for either a function of $\qinv$ or of a function of vector $\mathbf{q}$, where $R^2$ would be a symmetric matrix (with a single independent off-diagonal element coupling the ``out'' and ``long'' directions).
$\mathcal{N}$ is a free normalization parameter.
$K$ is set to the average value of $K(\qinv)$ in a given bin from the mixed-event background, $<K(\qinv)> = B_K/B$, where $B_K \equiv \sum_i K(\qinv^i)$ is the counts in a bin weighted by $K$.

As an alternative check to the previous method, a Poisson log-likelihood that accounts for uncertainty in both the signal and background can also be used.
The mixed-event background can be corrected by the Coulomb factor as per the discussion in section \ref{subsec:coulomb} (to ignore the Coulomb correction, set $K=1$).

\begin{equation} \tilde{B} \equiv (1-\lambda)B + \lambda B_{K} C_{\textrm{BE}} \end{equation}

$B_{K}$ denotes the background formed by weighting each pair by the Coulomb correction $K(\qinv)$.
The variance in a given bin is

\begin{equation} \sigma_{\tilde{B}}^2 = (1-\lambda)^2 B + 2\lambda(1-\lambda)B_{K} C_{\textrm{BE}} + \lambda^2 B_{K^2} C_{\textrm{BE}}^2 \end{equation}

where following the notation introduced above, $B_{K^2}$ is the mixed-event background in which each pair is weighted by the square of $K(\qinv)$.
The negative log-likelihood ratio that is minimized is then \cite{Soltz:1994PhDT} % Zajc's method

\begin{equation} - 2\ln \mathcal{L} = -2 \sum_{q_i} \left[ A - \tilde{B} + \left( A + \sigma_{\tilde{B}}^2 \right) \ln \left(1 - \frac{A - \tilde{B}}{A + \sigma_{\tilde{B}}^2} \right) \right]  \end{equation}

This alternate systematic is used as a cross-check, as described in Section \ref{sec:systematics}.
No significant difference is observed with this method, so it is not used in the results.

\section{Systematic uncertainties and cross-checks}
\label{sec:systematics}

The average effect of each systematic on \Rinv is shown in \Cref{table:rinv_syst} for each \kt bin.
The systematics in two centrality bins are shown in \Cref{table:rinv_syst_central,table:rinv_syst_peripheral}.
Similar tables are shown for the 3D radii in \Cref{table:rout_syst,table:rside_syst,table:rlong_syst}.
The systematics listed there are included in the final results.

\subsection{Generator for hard-process description}
The greatest difficulty by far in measuring HBT radii in small systems is in forming an accurate description of the background contribution from hard processes.
For the uncertainty in the hard-process contribution two effects are considered.
First, the variation in the translation from \pp to \pPb is taken as an uncertainty in the amplitude, as shown in \Cref{fig:mu_hijing_pp_pPb}.
Secondly, as described in \Cref{subsec:herwig_vs_pythia}, the width of the variation in the difference of $\frac{C^{+-}}{C^{\pm\pm}}$ between \Pythia and \Herwig (\Cref{fig:delta_mu_pythia_herwig}) is used as an additional systematic variation in the background amplitude.
This is to account for uncertainty arising from the specific choice of \Pythia as a generator.
Both uncertainties are expressed as a scaling factor times $\lbkgd$, so they can be evaluated by scaling $\mu$ (\Cref{eqn:lambdaBackPar,eqn:mu}):

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\log \mu} = \sigma^{p+p \rightarrow p+Pb}_{\log \mu} \oplus \sigma^{\Pythia-\Herwig}_{\log \mu} = 0.0413 \oplus 0.116 = 0.123
\end{equation}

The background amplitude \lbkgd is thus scaled up and down by 12.3\% to compute the systematic from the background.

\subsection{Rapidity dependence of hard-process description}

The background amplitude relations in \Cref{eqn:lambdaBackPar,eqn:rBackPar} are evaluated with \Pythia in both central ($|\kys| < 1$) and forward ($1 < |\kys| < 2$) rapidity intervals.
The width relationship (\Cref{eqn:rBackPar}) does not change significantly, but the relationship between the amplitudes (\Cref{eqn:lambdaBackPar}) does.
The parameterization is varied from the nominal (inclusive) expression to that for each of the different rapidity bins.
In three dimensions a 2nd-order polynomial is used instead of a sigmoid.
This variation is illustrated in \Cref{subsec:jet_frag_inv,subsec:jet_frag_3d}.

\subsection{Jet fragmentation background in 3D}

One alternative to \Cref{eqn:jet_frag_form_3d} is to describe the jet fragmentation in three dimensions as a simple function of \qinv only.
The average \kt in each centrality/\kt/\kys interval can be used in \Cref{eqn:q3_to_qinv} to contract $\mathbf{q}$ into \qinv.
The same parameters derived in the Lorentz invariant correlations could be used to describe the three-dimensional background as well.
This turns out to be an over-simplification, as shown in \Cref{fig:pythia_qosl_alt_bkgd}.
The form in \Cref{eqn:jet_frag_form_3d} is used as it clearly describes the jet fragmentation more accurately.

\begin{figure}[t]

\end{minipage}
\caption{Two functional forms for describing three-dimensional jet fragmentation. The blue line (\Cref{eqn:jet_frag_form_3d}) is the one used in the results, and the purple line (which describes the correlation as a function of \qinv only) clearly does not enjoy the same level of agreement.}
\label{fig:pythia_qosl_alt_bkgd}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Shape parameters of hard-process description}
The background parameters $\abkgd^\mathrm{inv}$, $\abkgd^\mathrm{out}$, and $\abkgd^\mathrm{sl}$ were varied by 0.1\% from the nominal values.
The typical effect on the HBT radii was seen to be on order 0.5\%, and this variation is not included in the reported systematic errors.

\subsection{Pion identification}
The \ac{PID} definition used for the nominal result is the "Middle" cut level defined in \Cref{sec:pid}.
Systematic uncertainties from imperfections in the particle identification are evaluated by repeating the analysis with both the "Loose" and "Tight" cut levels.
The effect on the radii is around 1--2\% for the lower \kt bins, but becomes more significant at higher momentum bins (presumably because they are relatively more populated with kaons and protons).

\subsection{Charge asymmetry}
The distinction between positive and negative pairs could come from the orientation of the overlap of the inner detector components.
The nominal value is taken to be the fit results from histograms filled with all same-sign pairs, and a systematic variation is taken to positive and negative pairs.

\subsection{Binning of $z$ position of Primary Vertex}
A significant difference in the radii at high \kt was observed when it was required that events only be mixed from within the same 5 mm wide bin in $z_\textrm{vtx}$, the longitudinal position of the primary vertex.

The variations in the radii between a bin size of 2 mm and 5 mm were found to be around $0.5 \%$, so a bin size of 5 mm is chosen and a systematic uncertainty is neglected.
It is required that the event-mixing buffer in a given $z_\textrm{vtx}$ bin be full before histograms are filled, which ensures that the signal and mixed-event background have the same $z_\textrm{vtx}$ distribution.

\subsection{Core fraction $x_c$}
A correlation function of the form

\begin{equation}
C(q) = \left(1-x_c + x_c K(\qinv)\left( 1 + \lambda e^{-"Rq"} \right) \right) C_{\textrm{bkgd}}(q)
\end{equation}

was also considered.
In this form $\lambda$ takes into account pion impurities, and $x_c$ indicates the fraction of pairs that come from a core (i.e. not from long-lived resonances or weak decays - see \Cref{fig:pythia_xc}).
The region of the correlation function that drives the fit results is both at a larger $\qinv$ than where the Coulomb correction $K(\qinv) \neq 1$ and at smaller $\qinv$ than where $e^{-\Rinv\qinv}$ can be neglected.
Here the correlation function looks like $C(q) \approx 1 + x_c \lambda e^{-"Rq"} C_{\textrm{bkgd}}(q)$, so the results are mostly dependent only on the product $x_c \lambda$.

The measured radii turn out to be for the most part extremely insensitive to variations in the core fraction $x_c$.
To emphasize this, $x_c$ is varied between 0.4 and 0.9.
This is surely an overestimation of the possible range, but the difference in the radii is still less than one percent for nearly all bins.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{minipage}[t]{1.0\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{pythia_xc.pdf}
\end{minipage}
\caption{The core fraction $x_c$ measured in \PYEight by counting the pairs in which neither particle is a product of a weak decay or of a $\eta$, $\eta'$, $\omega$, or $K*$.}
\label{fig:pythia_xc}
\end{figure}

Though a core fraction near 50\% is physically reasonable (as in \Cref{fig:pythia_xc}), it results in $\lambda$ parameters near 2.
$\lambda$ should always be less than 1 in order to be interpreted as a coefficient of a Bose-Einstein enhancement.
There is a redundancy in the description of the correlation function using both $x_c$ and $\lambda$.

To avoid over-parameterizing the fit and to avoid questionable values of $\lambda$, the choice was made to effectively take $\lambda \rightarrow 1$ and rename $x_c \rightarrow \lambda$, to match the typical presentation of the "Bowler-Sinyukov" formula $C(q) = \left( 1-\lambda + \lambda K(\qinv)\left( 1 + e^{-Rq} \right)\right) C_{\textrm{bkgd}}(q)$.

\subsection{Effective size for the Coulomb effect}
The non-zero effective size of the Coulomb correction \Reff should only provide a bin-by-bin difference of a few percent, even up to several fm.
However, since the parameter effectively changes the \qinv range over which the Coulomb correction is applied, varying this parameter can affect the HBT radii significantly.
The parameter \Reff is taken to be proportional to the invariant HBT radius, such that $\Reff = \xi \Rinv$.

The nominal value of $\xi$ is chosen to be equal to unity, and a variation down to $1/2$ and up to $2$ is taken to be the $1\sigma_{syst}$ level.

\subsection{Projection of $\mathbf{q}$ onto $\qinv$}
The value of \kt used to calculate \qinv from $\mathbf{q}$ in the 3D fits (see \Cref{eqn:q3_to_qinv}) is varied $\pm 1$ standard deviation of the \kt in each bin.
In three dimensions, the value of \qinv is only used in the Coulomb correction.
The effect on the radii is small, and the Coulomb correction is already varied through \Reff, so this variation is not included.
%%It is still included as a systematic in the 3D results.

%%is not expected to change \Rside or \Rlong appreciably since the part of the correlation function most relevant to those parameters is at $\qout = 0$, where $\qinv = |\mathbf{q}|$. It could possibly have a measureable effect on \Rout, however.

\subsection{Alternative test statistic}
The alternative test statistic mentioned in \Cref{sec:fit} is checked to to ensure that the fit results do not vary significantly as a result.
Indeed, the typical variation is less than $0.1\%$.
In the few exceptions, the difference is within range of the statistical error bar.
This effect is therefore not included in a systematic variation.

\subsection{Different functional forms}
While the exponential seems to be a clear choice for fitting $C(\qinv)$, there are a number of possible options for the out-side-long fits.
For instance, factorizing the longitudinal and transverse parts of the correlation function may provide a better quality of fit than assuming ellipsoidal symmetry.
This consideration will be taken as a possibility for future analysis.

\subsection{Two-particle track reconstruction effects}
It is typically assumed that effects like tracking efficiency and acceptance factor out of the ratio $A(q) / B(q)$.
However, one can reasonably question whether two-particle effects like ghosting can affect the correlation function.
To explore this possibility, the ratio of reconstructed to truth correlation functions are shown in \Cref{fig:2pc_effects}.
A significant effect above the few lowest \qinv bins is not observed.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{minipage}[t]{1.0\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{Cqinv_hijing_reco_vs_truth_cent3_e3_kt1.pdf}

\end{minipage}
\caption{A comparison of reconstructed to truth correlation functions using reconstructed \Hijing events.
The bottom shows the ratio truth / reco.}
\label{fig:2pc_effects}
\end{figure}

A minimum $q$ cutoff is applied in the fits to avoid being affected by detector effects like resolution and ghosting.
The sensitivity of the results to this limit is checked by taking $\qinv^\textrm{min} = 30 \pm 10 \MeV$ in the 1D fits and symmetrizing the effect of the variation from $|\mathbf{q}|^\textrm{min} = 25 + 25 \MeV$ in the 3D fits.

\subsection{Difference between two runs}

A useful cross-check on the measurement is that the results should not differ significantly between period A (Pb going in $+z$ direction) and period B (proton going in $+z$ direction).
\Cref{fig:fit_inv_R_split} illustrates the difference observed between the two runs, which is not significant.
The differences are comparable to statistical uncertainties - typically less than $0.5\%$ at low \kt and around $2\%$ at the upper end of the \kt bins.

\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{qinv_R_vs_kt_periodB.pdf}
\caption{Results for \Rinv split into both periods and both signs as a check.
No systematic uncertainties are included - this is intended as a cross-check.}
\label{fig:fit_inv_R_split}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Event plane resolution}
Uncertainty in the 2nd-order event plane resolution is propagated through the event plane resolution correction to the azimuthally-dependent results. There are two contributions to the \psit resolution, both of which are evaluated by changes to the two alternate sub-detectors used in the three-sub-detector method of evaluating $\langle \cos(2\delta\psit) \rangle$. For one variation, tracks weighted by their \pt are used instead of calorimeter cells, and for the other the rapidity windows of the alternate subsdetectors are shifted away from the nominal sub-detector by $\Delta\eta = 0.5$.

\subsection{Sampling uncertainty}
The effect of the sampling procedure on the pair distribution is evaluated by taking the ratio of the distributions of sampled pairs to traditional event-mixed pairs, as discussed in \Cref{subsubsec:bkgd_sampling}.
The uncertainty is determined by evaluating this ratio in the 8 intervals of $\kphi - \psit$ and 5 intervals of flow $|\qt|$, and using the endpoints of the middle 68.27\% interval (\Cref{fig:sample_to_mix_ratio}).
%% The uncertainty is determined by evaluating this ratio in each event class and in several intervals of $\kphi - \psit$ and using the endpoints of the middle 68.27\% interval of this whole collection (\Cref{fig:sample_to_mix_ratio_kt2}).
This procedure is measured separately for each \kt bin.

\subsection{Azimuthal de-correlation in rotated event mixing}
The sampling procedure necessitates an effective integration over event plane angle \psit, or the computing demands of the analysis would be unmanageable. While there is no dependence of the physics on the event plane angle due to average rotational symmetry of the collisions, variations in the track reconstruction efficiency can affect the correlation between pairs of tracks. A pair distribution formed with event mixing is compared to a similar distribution in which one event is rotated azimuthally by a uniform random angle. The ratio of these distributions indicates the effect of the detector response on the pair correlation. The pair distribution is corrected by this ratio. The uncertainty in the ratio is evaluated by taking the endpoints of the middle 68.27\% of the variation in different runs and multiplicity bins (\Cref{fig:phi_corr_to_uncorr_ratio}). This accounts for variations in the pair response that may change between runs.

The total systematic uncertainty is shown along with the three largest sources. The quadrature sum of the remaining systematic uncertainties is also shown.}
\label{fig:azi_syst_breakdown}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:azi_syst_breakdown} shows the uncertainties contributing to the relative modulation of each of the main HBT radii. The dominant systematic effect is the \ac{PID}. This is partially due to the fact that the \ac{PID} systematic variation is performed by using looser and tighter \ac{PID} cuts, which gives the variation a statistical component as well. There is also a physical element, as different particle species are expected to freeze out at different times in an expanding source's evolution.

The systematic uncertainties for the Fourier components are smoothed over different values of $|\qt|$. For each source of systematic variation, the uncertainty at each point is averaged with the uncertainty of its nearest neighbors, with double weighting given to its own value. This is done separately for the upwards and downwards variations of each source of systematic uncertainty, before all contributions are summed in quadrature. The use of this simple smoothing kernel reduces the effect of statistical fluctuations in the systematic uncertainties, without drastically changing the qualitative evolution of the size of the variations over $|\qt|$.
