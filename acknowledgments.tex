\chapter{Acknowledgments} %I use an asterisk because I don't want my acknowledgements in the table of contents. I use \chapter to make sure that the acknowledgements go on the correct side of the page when you print out the dissertation.

A thesis is not produced in a vacuum.
Countless people have contributed directly and indirectly over the years, and I can only highlight some of them here.

Mick and Janice, my parents and first teachers, provided no end of emotional, developmental, and financial support.
They never ceased to be available for me and I would not be here without them.
My siblings Rachel, Josh, and David each helped me grow in their own ways during my childhood and to this day.

I am especially grateful to my advisor Brian Cole for his continual mentorship during my graduate career.
He has taught me a lot about the experimental process and I can only hope to one day have a fraction of his scientific instincts.
His energy, generosity, and flexibility have been helpful far beyond the level of obligation.
Besides all this, he has excellent taste in beer.

I would like to thank many others in the Columbia heavy ion group as well.
Bill Zajc was an incredible resource particularly when I was a fresh new grad student trying to wrap my head around the kind of measurements in this thesis.
Aaron Angerami was extremely generous with his time, going well out of his way to train new students and always being available for any sort of question.
