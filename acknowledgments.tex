\chapter{Acknowledgments} %I use an asterisk because I don't want my acknowledgements in the table of contents. I use \chapter to make sure that the acknowledgements go on the correct side of the page when you print out the dissertation.

A thesis is not produced in a vacuum.
Countless people have contributed directly and indirectly over the years, and I can only highlight some of them here.

Mick and Janice, my parents and first teachers, provided no end of emotional, developmental, and financial support.
They never ceased to be available for me and I would not be here without them.
My siblings Rachel, Josh, and David each helped me grow in their own ways during my childhood and to this day.
I love you all.
