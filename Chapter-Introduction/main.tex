%% theory lol: ``I can believe things that are true and things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not.'' -- Neil Gaiman

 notes:

 we see collectivity in even fairly low multiplicity pp, and it doesn't look particularly like hydro (?) (see Z-tagged pp v2). refer to AMPT (, CGC ?) models that predict v2 in pp. this thesis will argue that the collectivity in central \pPb has specific features that suggest hydro -- it's not clear in low multiplicity.
