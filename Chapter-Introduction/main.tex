 notes:

 we see collectivity in even fairly low multiplicity pp, and it doesn't look particularly like hydro (?) (see Z-tagged pp v2). refer to AMPT (, CGC ?) models that predict v2 in pp. this thesis will argue that the collectivity in central \pPb has specific features that suggest hydro -- it's not clear in low multiplicity.

 eta/s from ADS/CFT
